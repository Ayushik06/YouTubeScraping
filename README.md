# YouTubeScraping
This Python project leverages the YouTube Data API to scrape data from YouTube channels. The goal is to extract key metrics and information, such as subscriber count, video count, view count, and recent uploads, from multiple YouTube channels and then combine this data for comprehensive analysis.
